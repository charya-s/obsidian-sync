### X is (not) Y

To link one noun to another noun, you can use:

> **noun1 + 是 + noun2**
> *noun1 + is/am/are + noun2*

Take note that **是** is only used if the descriptor is a noun. If the descriptor is an adjective, you can use:

> **noun + 很 + adjective**
> *noun1 + very + adjective*

Examples:
- wǒ shì Charya / 我是 Charya → I am Charya.
- nǐ hěn piàoliang / 你很漂亮 → You very pretty.

### X is at Y

To say that a subject is at a known location, you can use:

>**subject + 在 + location**
> *subject + at/in/exists + location*

### X is at Y relative to Z

If the sentence contains two subjects, where subject 1's location is relative to subject 2, you can use:

> *subject 1 + at/in/exists + subject 2 + location*

You can add **的** if and only if the location belongs to subject 2.

Examples:

- nǐ zài huǒchēzhàn ma? / 你在火车站吗？-> You at train station?
- māmā zài wǒ de jiā / 妈妈在我的家 -> Mother at my home.
