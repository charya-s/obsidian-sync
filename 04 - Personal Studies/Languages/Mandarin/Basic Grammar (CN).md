### X is Y

To link one noun to another noun, you can use:

> **noun1 + 是 + noun2**
> *noun1 + is/am/are + noun2*

Take note that **是** is only used if the descriptor is a noun. If the descriptor is an adjective, you can use:

> **noun + 很 + adjective**
> *noun1 + very + adjective*

Examples:
- wǒ shì Charya / 我是 Charya → I am Charya.
- nǐ hěn piàoliang / 你很漂亮 → You very pretty.

### ### X is not Y

In the case of linking two nouns, to negate **是**, you can use:

> **noun1 + 不 + 是 + noun2**
> *noun1 + not + is/am/are + noun2*

In the case of linking a noun to an adjective, you can use:

> **noun + 不 + adjective**
> *noun1 + not + adjective*

Take note that **很** is replaced by **不** in the noun–adjective case. In contrast, in the noun-noun case, **不** is used as a modifier to **是**.

Examples:
- wǒ bù shì Charya / 我不是 Charya → I not am Charya.
- nǐ bù piàoliang / 你不漂亮 → You not pretty.

---
### Possession

To show possession between a subject and an object, you can use:

>**subject + 的 + object**
> *subject + owns/possesses + object

Examples:
- wǒ de míngzì / 我在超市里面 -> I at supermarket inside.
- nǐ zài huǒchēzhàn ma? / 你在火车站吗？-> You at train station?
- māmā zài wǒ de jiā / 妈妈在我的家 -> Mother at my home.
