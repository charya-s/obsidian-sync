### Where is X?

To ask where a subject is, you can use:

> **subject + 在 + 那/哪里**
> *subject + at/in/exists + where?*

Take note that **那** is more common in the North (Beijing), while **哪里** is more common in the South (Shanghai).

Examples:
- nî zài nâr? / 你在那？-> You at where? / Where are you?
- Jiā zài nâlî? / 家在那里？-> Home at where? / Where is (your) home?

To say that a subject is at a known location, you can use:

>**subject + 在 + location**
> *subject + at/in/exists + location*

If the sentence contains two subjects, where subject 1's location is relative to subject 2, you can use:

>**subject + 在 + subject 2 + location**
> *subject 1 + at/in/exists + subject 2 + location
