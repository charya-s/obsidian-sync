### X is Y

To link one noun to another noun, you can use:

> **noun1 + 是 + noun2**
> *noun1 + is/am/are + noun2*

Take note that **是** is only used if the descriptor is a noun. If the descriptor is an adjective, you can use:

> **noun + 很 + adjective**
> *noun1 + very + adjective*

Examples:
- wǒ shì Charya / 我是 Charya → I am Charya.
- nǐ hěn piàoliang / 你很漂亮 → You very pretty.

### X is not Y

In the case of linking two nouns, to negate **是**, you can use:

> **noun1 + 不 + 是 + noun2**
> *noun1 + not + is/am/are + noun2*

In the case of linking a noun to an adjective, you can use:

> **noun + 不 + adjective**
> *noun1 + not + adjective*

Take note that **很** is replaced by **不** in the noun–adjective case. In contrast, in the noun-noun case, **不** is used as a modifier to **是**.

Examples:
- wǒ bù shì Charya / 我不是 Charya → I not am Charya.
- nǐ bù piàoliang / 你不漂亮 → You not pretty.

### Possession

Examples:
- wǒ de míngzì shì Charya / 我的名字是 Charya -> My name is Charya.
- tā shì nǐ de māmā ma? / 他是你的妈妈吗？-> She is your mother?
