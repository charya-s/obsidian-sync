### Using Measure Words

Measure words are used when counting as follows:

> **number + measure word + noun**
> *noun1 + measure word + noun2*

Take note that **是** is only used if the descriptor is a noun. If the descriptor is an adjective, you can use:

> **noun + 很 + adjective**
> *noun1 + very + adjective*

Examples:
- wǒ shì Charya / 我是 Charya → I am Charya.
- nǐ hěn piàoliang / 你很漂亮 → You very pretty.
