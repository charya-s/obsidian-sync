### Counting Past 10, Up To 9999

A large number is constructed by simply combining units, tens, hundreds, etc. as follows. 

>**thousands value + 千 + hundreds value + 百 + tens value +  十 + ones value**
>*thousands value + thousand + hundreds value + hundred + tens value +  ten + ones value*

Take note that this works almost identically to English, where you’d say something like, “Four thousand, five hundred and fifty five”.

Examples:
- yī qiān sì bǎi wǔ shí sān / 一千四百五十三 → One thousand four hundred five ten three (1453).
- jiǔ qiān jiǔ bǎi jiǔ shí jiǔ / 九千九百九十九 → Nine thousand nine hundred nine ten ten (9999).

### Two Twos

Both **二** and **两** can be used for the number “2”. 

> **两** is used for measuring and all other 
> **二** is used when not measuring or is the measurement ends in 2.

Take note that **两** is more commonly used, but there isn’t a hard rule. It’s ambiguous.

Examples:
- wǒ shì Charya / 我是 Charya → I am Charya.
- nǐ hěn piàoliang / 你很漂亮 → You very pretty.
