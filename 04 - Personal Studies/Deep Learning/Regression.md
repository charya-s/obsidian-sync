This is a form of [[Supervised Learning]] used for prediction using line extrapolation.

## Linear Regression
$$
f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b
$$
where $f_{w,b}(x)$ is the target, $x$ is the feature and $w$ is the weight and $b$ is the6 bias. 

Therefore, for a point $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$,
$$
\hat{y}^{(i)} = wx^{(i)} + b
$$
The most commonly used [[Cost Functions]] for this type of model is "Squared Error".
