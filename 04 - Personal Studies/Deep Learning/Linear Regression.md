This is a form of [[Supervised Learning]] used for prediction using straight line extrapolation.

$$
f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b
$$
where $f_{w,b}(x)$ is the target, $x$ is the feature and $w$ is the weight and $b$ is the6 bias. 

Therefore, for a point $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$,
$$
\hat{y}^{(i)} = wx^{(i)} + b
$$
And the cost function is,
$$
\sum
$$
