After [[Forward Propagation]] is complete and an output, $\hat{y}$ is produced, it is compared to the expected output, $y$ and an error rate is calculated using [[Loss Functions]]. 

Using the loss, we can adjust the weights between nodes to bring $\hat{y}$ closer to $y$. This is done iteratively until the error rate reaches a minimum value, without [[Overfitting and Underfitting]].
