This is the most basic application of game theory. Consider the following:
- Player A and Player B are playing a game to win money.
- Each player must choose whether they want to "Split" the money or "Steal" the money.
- If both players "Split", they each get 3 coins.
- If one player chooses to "Split" and the other chooses to "Steal", the one who steals will receive 5 coins and the one who splits will receive none.
- If both players "Steal", they will receive 1 coin each.

Should each player "Split" or "Steal"? 

|           | Player B      |
| ------
|           | Split | Steal |
| --------- | ----- | ----- |
| **Split** | 3, 3  | 0, 3  |
| **Steal** | 3, 0  | 1, 1  |
|           |       |       |
