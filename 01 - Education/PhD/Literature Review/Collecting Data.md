Both [[Electromyogram Sensors]] and [[Inertial Sensors]] will be used simultaneously to ensure that the data collected is accurate and robust.

Both methods require monitoring to be done during ambulatory activities such as walking, jogging and running. In the case of the EMG sensors, this is so that there is sufficient muscle activity to be measured, and in the case of the inertial sensors, it is so that there is motion to be measured.
