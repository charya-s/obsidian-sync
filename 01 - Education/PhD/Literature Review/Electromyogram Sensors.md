EMG sensors measure the electrical activity generated by skeletal muscles, providing insights into muscle activation patterns. 

An EMG diagram is comprised of two axes: the time in seconds on the x-axis and the amplitude in millivolts on the y-axis. The amplitude corresponds to the degree of activation of the muscle, where a larger amplitude implies a larger activation and zero amplitude implying no activity.

The most common form is of EMG sensing is "surface EMG", where "electrodes" are attached to the surface of the skin over the muscle that is to be examined. These electrodes are connected via wires to monitors, which parse the signals produced into an EMG diagram. Given its methodology, this form is best used for superficial muscles, which are those that are close to the skin. Wearable EMG sensors use dry electrodes that are easy to use and have a long lifespan, making them suitable for long-term monitoring.

The other common form is "inserted EMG", which utilizes a needle to monitor deeper muscles whose activations would otherwise be undetectable from the surface.

In [[00 - PhD]], surface EMG is used over inserted EMG as the muscle groups that affect gait, those of the hip, knee and ankle, are all superficial.
