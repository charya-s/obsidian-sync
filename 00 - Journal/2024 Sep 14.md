My video on whether "Throne and Liberty" is worth playing took off! I had a hunch that the title wasn't really making it show up in search results so I changed it to include more keywords and it really paid off. It went from my second worst performing video to now being my third *best* performing video. I do think it'll fall in the rankings over time but if it can break 2,000 views, it'll be the first to do since I stopped making ones about Tarisland, so it'd still be a huge win for me.

Other than that though, I didn't get much done. The only productive thing I did was helping Amanda write her research interests for her Master's application. 

Pretty much most of the day I spent on EU4, which was also fun.
