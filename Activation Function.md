These are non-linear functions that convert the raw output of a perceptron into a desirable output. Different activation functions perform this conversion in different ways.

Activation functions are necessary for neural networks because, without them, the output of the model would simply be a linear function of the input. In other words, it wouldnâ€™t be able to handle large volumes of complex data. Activation functions are an additional step in each forward propagation layer but a valuable one.
