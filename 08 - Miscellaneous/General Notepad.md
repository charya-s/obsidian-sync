During my Bachelor of Psychology, I conducted multiple research projects under different supervisors on topics that 

  

The most notable one was on the barriers to mental health support faced by refugees. Upon reading multiple literature on this matter, I concluded that the main causes to this were financial infeasibility, a lack of awareness and stigmatization among the refugee population. This study was focused on further understanding what we can do to help the underprivileged.

  

I have previously learned to use the SPSS software JASP and R Studio to process any data being used for my research papers.Â 

  

Similar to what I have researched in the past, my personal passion is on granting easier access to mental health care to the underprivileged. Specifically, I would like to further understand the barriers to treatment among those who suffer with narcotic addiction. Often stigmatized due to the unpleasant behavior and appearance caused by narcotics, it is important to understand how we can help those who are unable to help themselves.
