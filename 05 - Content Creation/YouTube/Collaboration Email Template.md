Hi ***NAME***,

My name is Charya (**YouTube**:Â [kets and his games](https://www.youtube.com/@ketsandhisgames)), and I'm a fellow MMORPG content creator like you. I'm writing to you to get in touch in the hopes that we can collaborate later down the line. I'm particularly interested in joining in on a conversation about Throne and Liberty, other MMOs or even the state of the genre as a whole! I think we could have a ton of fun talking about everything.

Here's a link to my latest video for you to see what my content is like:

I look forward to hearing back from you soon, and I'm really excited to potentially work with you!

Regards,
kets
