## Notes

### Intro
*Duration: 00s.* 
- Now, despite the massive release of Throne and Liberty and the Alpha 2 of Ashes of Creation starting, a lot of you might still feel like your itch for a good new MMO is unsatisfied. 
- Don’t worry, 2024 isn’t done yet and neither are MMO studios.
- Hello everybody and welcome to another MMO video where today, we’re gonna talk about the MMOs coming in November and December of 2024.
- Now, I know you don’t have all day, you’re a busy person with things to do, so I’ve narrowed down the list to the four biggest, most promising and most interesting MMOs releasing in the next two months and we’ll go through them from least exciting to most exciting in my opinion.

*Duration: 00s.* 

### Outro
*Duration: 00s.* 
- And there you have it! Those are the four biggest releases coming in November and December of 2024 in order of least exciting to most exciting.
- Now, a quick disclaimer, while all of these MMOs *are* expected to come out in the next couple of months, this is never a guarantee with this genre. 


Now, even though there haven't been any further delays at the time this video goes up, these are still all MMOs, so keep in mind that pretty much any of them could be delayed at any time. That's just the way the cookie seems to crumble in this genre these days.
Anyway, that's enough outta me. What do you guys think? Are there any MMOs you're excited for that I missed? What do you think about the state of MMOs nowadays? Make sure you let me know in the comments below - I'd love to hear from you all!
As always, thank you for watching and make sure you subscribe to my channel below for more MMO-related content but until then, I'll see you guys next time.
