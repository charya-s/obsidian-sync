### Outro
*Duration: 00s.* 
- And there you have it! Those are the four biggest releases coming in November and December of 2024 in order of least exciting to most exciting.
- Now, a quick disclaimer, while all of these MMOs *are* expected to come out in the next couple of months, this is never a guarantee with this genre. 
- Delays are basically a main part of MMOs now and there’s nothing we can do about it.
- Anyway, I got a chicken in the oven I forgot about so I got to go, but I really, really wanna hear from you guys before I do!
- What do you guys think? Are there any MMOs you're excited for that I missed? Which do you plan on playing?
- Let me know in the comments below but please type fast because my chicken’s gonna burn and trust me, you don’t want that on your conscience.
