In this video, we'll be going through each class combination and rating them in three categories: PvE, PvP and Difficulty. Each rating will be out of 5 (star system). Additionally, we'll also provide some information about the playstyle of the combination and a suggestion of what kind of player would like it.

### Intro
- 

### Class System
- T&L does not have a traditional class system.
- Instead, the skills you have depends on weapon combinations (two weapons).
	- You can freely change your weapon combination whenever you'd like.
	- There's no such thing as a primary or secondary weapon, both weapons equipped are treated equally.
	- I will call these combinations classes for convenience.
- You have limited skill slots but you can choose any mix of skills from both weapons.
- This is something I really like for two reasons:
	- Firstly, if you ever get bored of a class, you can always just play something else for a while.
	- Secondly, it gives you a lot of freedom and creativity to come up with your own build. Metas exist but you are able to select a combination of weapons and a combination of skills that suits you the best. 
- Since there's no restriction in changing classes, I recommend shortlisting a few of the combinations that look interesting to you from this video and trying them out yourself before you settle on one.

### The Weapons
- Okay, so there are seven main weapons in T&L to choose from.
- There's the **Greatsword**, which is a melee weapon, so very short range, that has great AoE skills, generally good survivability, and some mobility thrown in.
- Then, there's the **Sword and Shield**, another short-ranged melee class, but unlike the GS, it focuses on being extremely tanky and in fact, it's the only tank weapon in the game.
- The final melee weapon is the **Dagger**, which is based on high mobility and damage over time.
- After that, there's the **Longbow**, which is a long-range weapon. In fact, it is the *longest* range weapon in the game and excel at single-target damage.
- Then, you have the **Crossbow**, which is best single-target weapon in the game and works from medium range, though medium range in this game is still quite close.
- Following that, we have our first magic weapon, the **Staff**. This is another long-range weapon, though a bit shorter than the Longbow, and it excels at AoE damage.
- Finally, we have the **Wand**, which is the only true support weapon, focusing on buffing and healing allies as well as debuffing enemies.
- And that's it, those are the seven weapons available. 
	- Again, you can use any two of these weapons at the same time, getting access to all their skills with no penalty.
	- So with that in mind, let's talk about each combination!

| Greatsword       | This weapon is all about very-short ranged AoE damage. Its skills make you fight up close and personal and it's got a little bit of mobility for repositioning. The playstyle for this weapon is based around jumping into the middle of a group of enemies and making big, wide swings of your sword, a signature move being to spin with it, to do really good AoE damage around you.                                                                                                                         | 1. **Sword and Shield**: This combines the AoE DPS of the Greatsword with the tankiness of the Sword and Shield. This combination is great for people who like fighting up close and personal with big AoE, swings while still being beefy and face tanking hits. Imagine this as a 7-foot barbarian warrior with a giant sword who makes big, wide but slow swings and can take hits all day.<br><br>2. **Dagger**: Much less tanky than with the SnS, but more more agile and mobile. This combination is great for people who like the AoE melee style of the Greatsword but instead of standing around face tanking hits, you wanna dash around more as you fight, try this class. You can imagine this more like how anime battles with massive swords look like where like two skinny teenagers will fight faster than the eye can see. |
| Sword and Shield | This weapon is all about fighting up close and personal as well, but instead of doing damage, it focuses on being incredibly tanky. In fact, it’s the tankiest weapon in the game and will you’ll rarely have trouble surviving with it. The playstyle for this weapon is to act as a wall between an enemy or even a group of enemies, drawing their attention and taking their hits in the place of your teammates.                                                                                           | 1. **Wand**: This is go-to choice for the Sword and Shield, because the buffs and self-healing provided by the wand increase your tankiness by a significant amount. In fact, this is the tankiest combination in the game. This combination is great for those who wanna play in the front lines, leading the charge and taking all the hits, capable of surviving damn near anything. Imagine this as a paladin clad head to toe in armor, who protects his allies and is incredibly hard to phase.<br><br>2. **Greatsword**: See Greatsword section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Dagger           | The dagger is a high mobility weapon that focuses on damage-over-time rather than big hits. The damage numbers on hits might look low, but they happen fast and add up really quickly. The playstyle for the dagger is to be very mobile, quickly dashing around enemies, inflicting a lot of strikes that leave them crippled and poisoned. It’s death by a thousand cuts, but as a result, it’s not that great at AoE, and really shines in single-target damage, especially against enemies with lots of HP. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
