In this video, we'll be going through each class combination and rating them in three categories: PvE, PvP and Difficulty. Each rating will be out of 5 (star system). Additionally, we'll also provide some information about the playstyle of the combination and a suggestion of what kind of player would like it.

### Intro
- 

### Class System
- T&L does not have a traditional class system.
- Instead, the skills you have depends on weapon combinations (two weapons).
	- You can freely change your weapon combination whenever you'd like.
	- There's no such thing as a primary or secondary weapon, both weapons equipped are treated equally.
	- I will call these combinations classes for convenience.
- You have limited skill slots but you can choose any mix of skills from both weapons.
- This is something I really like for two reasons:
	- Firstly, if you ever get bored of a class, you can always just play something else for a while.
	- Secondly, it gives you a lot of freedom and creativity to come up with your own build. Metas exist but you are able to select a combination of weapons and a combination of skills that suits you the best. 
- Since there's no restriction in changing classes, I recommend shortlisting a few of the combinations that look interesting to you from this video and trying them out yourself before you settle on one.

### The Weapons
- Okay, so there are seven main weapons in T&L to choose from.
- There's the **Greatsword**, which is a melee weapon, so very short range, that has great AoE skills, generally good survivability, and some mobility thrown in.
- Then, there's the **Sword and Shield**, another short-ranged melee class, but unlike the GS, it focuses on being extremely tanky and in fact, it's the only tank weapon in the game.
- The final melee weapon is the **Dagger**, which is based on high mobility and damage over time.
- After that, there's the **Longbow**, which is a long-range weapon. In fact, it is the *longest* range weapon in the game and excel at single-target damage.
- Then, you have the **Crossbow**, which is best single-target weapon in the game and works from medium range, though medium range in this game is still quite close.
- Following that, we have our first magic weapon, the **Staff**. This is another long-range weapon, though a bit shorter than the Longbow, and it excels at AoE damage.
- Finally, we have the **Wand**, which is the only true support weapon, focusing on buffing and healing allies as well as debuffing enemies.
- And that's it, those are the seven weapons available. 
	- Again, you can use any two of these weapons at the same time, getting access to all their skills with no penalty.
	- So with that in mind, let's talk about each combination!
