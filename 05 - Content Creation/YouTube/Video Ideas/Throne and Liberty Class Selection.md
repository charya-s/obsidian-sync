In this video, we'll be going through each class combination and rating them in three categories: PvE, PvP and Difficulty. Each rating will be out of 5 (star system). Additionally, we'll also provide some information about the playstyle of the combination and a suggestion of what kind of player would like it.

### Intro

### Class System
- T&L does not have a traditional class system.
- Instead, the skills you have depends on weapon combinations (two weapons).
	- You can freely change your weapon combination whenever you'd like.
	- There's no such thing as a primary or secondary weapon, both weapons equipped are treated equally.
	- I will call these combinations classes for convenience.
- You have limited skill slots but you can choose any mix of skills from both weapons.
- This is something I really like for two reasons:
	- Firstly, if you ever get bored of a class, you can always just play something else for a while.
	- Secondly, it gives you a lot of freedom and creativity to come up with your own build. Metas exist but you are able to select a combination of weapons and a combination of skills that suits you the best. 
- Since there's no restriction in changing classes, I recommend shortlisting a few of the combinations that look interesting to you from this video and trying them out yourself before you settle on one.

### The Weapons
- Okay, so there are seven main weapons in T&L to choose from.
- There's the **Greatsword**, which is a melee weapon, so very short range, that has great AoE skills, generally good survivability, and some mobility thrown in.
- Then, there's the **Sword and Shield**, another short-ranged melee class, but unlike the GS, it focuses on being extremely tanky. 
- After that, there's the **Longbow**, which is a long-range weapon. In fact, it is the *longest* range weapon in the game and excel at single-target damage.
- Then, you have the crossbow, which is best single-target weapon in the game and works from medium range, though medium range in this game is still quite close.

| Hello everybody! Welcome to a quick little guide for Throne and Liberty where we talk about one of the hardest decisions an MMO player has to make ever, which is on the question of... What Class Should You Choose? |                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                |
| Okay, before we go any further, I should mention that in Throne and Liberty, you're actually not locked into a class at all.                                                                                          |                |
| In fact, there actually aren't even any strict classes to choose from at all. The skills you can use and the playstyle you have will depend instead on the combination of weapons you have equipped.                  |                |
