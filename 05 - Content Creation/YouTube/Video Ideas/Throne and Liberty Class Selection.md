In this video, we'll be going through each class combination and rating them in three categories: PvE, PvP and Difficulty. Each rating will be out of 5 (star system). Additionally, we'll also provide some information about the playstyle of the combination and a suggestion of what kind of player would like it.

### Intro

### Class System
- T&L does not have a traditional class system.
- Instead, the skills you have depends on weapon combinations (two weapons).
	- There's no such thing as a primary or secondary weapon, both weapons equipped are treated equally.
- You have limited skill slots but you can choose any mix of skills from both weapons.
- This is something I really lik

| Hello everybody! Welcome to a quick little guide for Throne and Liberty where we talk about one of the hardest decisions an MMO player has to make ever, which is on the question of... What Class Should You Choose? |                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                |
| Okay, before we go any further, I should mention that in Throne and Liberty, you're actually not locked into a class at all.                                                                                          |                |
| In fact, there actually aren't even any strict classes to choose from at all. The skills you can use and the playstyle you have will depend instead on the combination of weapons you have equipped.                  |                |
