In this video, we'll be going through each class combination and rating them in three categories: PvE, PvP and Difficulty. Each rating will be out of 5 (star system). Additionally, we'll also provide some information about the playstyle of the combination and a suggestion of what kind of player would like it.

## Script

### Intro
- 

### Class System
- T&L does not have a traditional class system.
- Instead, the skills you have depends on weapon combinations (two weapons).
	- You can freely change your weapon combination whenever you'd like.
	- There's no such thing as a primary or secondary weapon, both weapons equipped are treated equally.
	- I will call these combinations classes for convenience.
- You have limited skill slots but you can choose any mix of skills from both weapons.
- This is something I really like for two reasons:
	- Firstly, if you ever get bored of a class, you can always just play something else for a while.
	- Secondly, it gives you a lot of freedom and creativity to come up with your own build. Metas exist but you are able to select a combination of weapons and a combination of skills that suits you the best. 
- Since there's no restriction in changing classes, I recommend shortlisting a few of the combinations that look interesting to you from this video and trying them out yourself before you settle on one.

| Greatsword       | This weapon is all about very-short ranged AoE damage. Its skills make you fight up close and personal and it's got a little bit of mobility for repositioning. The playstyle for this weapon is based around jumping into the middle of a group of enemies and making big, wide swings of your sword, a signature move being to spin with it, to do really good AoE damage around you.                                                                                                                                                                 | 1. **Sword and Shield**: This combines the AoE DPS of the Greatsword with the tankiness of the Sword and Shield. This combination is great for people who like fighting up close and personal with big AoE, swings while still being beefy and face tanking hits. Imagine this as a 7-foot barbarian warrior with a giant sword who makes big, wide but slow swings and can take hits all day.<br><br>2. **Dagger**: Much less tanky than with the SnS, but more more agile and mobile. This combination is great for people who like the AoE melee style of the Greatsword but instead of standing around face tanking hits, you wanna dash around more as you fight, try this class. You can imagine this more like how anime battles with massive swords look like where like two skinny teenagers will fight faster than the eye can see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Sword and Shield | This weapon is all about fighting up close and personal as well, but instead of doing damage, it focuses on being incredibly tanky. In fact, it’s the tankiest weapon in the game and will you’ll rarely have trouble surviving with it. The playstyle for this weapon is to act as a wall between an enemy or even a group of enemies, drawing their attention and taking their hits in the place of your teammates.                                                                                                                                   | 1. **Wand**: This is go-to choice for the Sword and Shield, because the buffs and self-healing provided by the wand increase your tankiness by a significant amount. In fact, this is the tankiest combination in the game. This combination is great for those who wanna play in the front lines, leading the charge and taking all the hits, capable of surviving damn near anything. Imagine this as a paladin clad head to toe in armor, who protects his allies and is incredibly hard to phase.<br><br>2. **Greatsword**: See Greatsword section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Dagger           | The dagger is a high mobility weapon that focuses on damage-over-time rather than big hits. The damage numbers on hits might look low, but they happen fast and add up really quickly. The playstyle for the dagger is to be very mobile, quickly dashing around enemies, inflicting a lot of strikes that leave them crippled and poisoned. It’s death by a thousand cuts, but as a result, it’s not that great at AoE, and really shines in single-target damage, especially against enemies with lots of HP.                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Longbow          | This is the weapon with the longest range in Throne and Liberty, and it excels at single target damage. It does have some AoE, but the focus is more on chaining skills back to back, to constantly barrage the enemy with arrows. The playstyle for this weapon is to keep your distance, standing still and continiously chaining arrows onto your target. By itself, this is probably the easiest weapon in the game but its damage potential is extremely high.                                                                                     | 1. **Dagger**: This combination is a bit of a sneaky one, because the dagger works mostly in the background, mostly providing loads of mobility so that you can make sure that you’re keeping your distance throughout the fight, while still being able to do a bit of damage up close. This combination is great for people who like kiting enemies from a distance without standing still. Imagine it sort of as Legolas from the Lord of the Ring series, an agile archer who’s also capable to fighting up close every now and then.<br><br>2. **Crossbow**: This combination works kind of similarly to the dagger in that it’s based around kiting, but instead of consistently keeping a big distance, you’d be kiting from the middle distance. This combination is great for people who enjoy kiting but not too far from the action, and for those who like lots of damage numbers on their screen. You can imagine this kind of like Legolas too, but he’s launching multiple arrows at a time while running around.<br><br>3. **Staff**: This combination has the longest range in the game and is fantastic for both AoE and single-target damage. This combination is great for people who like standing further away from the action, in the backline, almost standing still while you cast spell after spell and rain arrows down on your enemies in quick succession. Imagine it as the backline of a battle, constantly barraging enemy forces with magic and arrows. |
| Crossbow         | The crossbow is a medium-range weapon that is the best single-target weapon in the game. Now, medium-range in this game is still kind of close, but it’s definitely not as close as the melee weapons. This weapon is kind of like the dagger in that it’s very mobile and focuses on doing a lot of small strikes that add up rather than slow, big ones. The playstyle for this weapon is based around constant movement, doing damage while in motion, never letting yourself get caught in enemy attacks.                                           | 1. **Dagger**: This combination has the highest single-target DPS in the game and is extremely mobile. This combination is great for people who like doing damage while in motion, constantly zipping in and out between short range and medium range while barraging the enemy with a ton of small hits. Imagine this more as a skirmisher, where you make a countless number of small hits, moving in and out of danger, instead of one big hit.<br><br>3. **Longbow**: See Longbow section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Staff            | This is main long-ranged magic weapon in T&L, and though the range is a bit shorter than the Longbow, this weapon excels at AoE damage. You’d be raining down frost, flame and electricity on your enemies while standing at a safe distance. The playstyle of this weapon is quite similar to that of the longbow where you stand in the backline doing damage, except that it’s much slower, but to balance that out, each hit hits much harder.                                                                                                      | 1. **Wand**: This combination is super similar to the Longbow and Staff combination but it focuses much more on AoE damage than single-target damage. This makes it a great choice for people who like standing in the backline while you cast spell after spell, just like with the Longbow, but instead of arrows, want to rain down AoE fire, ice and lighting. You can imagine the same role as with the Longbow, but think more meteors and icicles and chain lightning. Flashier and harder hitting, for sure, but also slower and less of a barrage.<br><br>2. **Dagger**: This might sound like it clashes, but thanks to the Dagger's mobility and ability to close and create space, it's actually a surprisingly good hybrid between long-ranged magic and short range damage-over-time strikes. This combination would be great for people who like to cast spells while also being super mobile, weaving in and out of the front line as you do damage in passing. Imagine this as sort of a crazed mage assassin who loves the thrill and danger of a battle, living on the edge, getting just close enough to do damage before retreating beyond the enemy's grasp.<br><br>3. **Longbow**: See Longbow section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Wand             | The wand is the only true support weapon in the game, focusing on buffing and healing allies as well as debuffing enemies. This weapon’s supportive abilities are not just good, they’re amazing and they can often be literally required for some of the more difficult fights. The playstyle for this weapon is mostly to stand in the backline and use your skills but you shouldn’t underestimate the difficulty of it, because you need to pay attention to cooldowns, status effects, your teammates health, and a lot more to be a good support. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
