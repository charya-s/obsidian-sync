Now that T&L has begun its early access, there’s a lot of conversation around whether its a Pay-to-Win game or not. For some reason, there’s a lot of people who seem to have come to the conclusion that it isn’t. They’re wrong, here’s why and why this is a problem for the whole genre.

## Notes

### Intro 
*Duration: 64s.* 
- Hello everybody and welcome… to another Throne and Liberty video where we are going to maybe piss off a few people. 
- The game is now in its Early Access stage until it fully comes out on the 1st of October and the question of whether it is Pay-To-Win is one that’s generating a lot of discussion.
- There are people who swear it is and there are people who say it’s not really pay-to-win and instead it’s just pay-for-convenience.
- Now of you just want to know if T&L is Pay-to-Win or not, I won’t waste your time. It is, it definitely is pay-to-win.
- So why are people pretending it’s not? Let’s talk about that. Or, at least, I’ll talk about it first and the n afterwards, we can talk about it together in the comments. 
- We’re gonna go step by step. First we’ll figure out, logically, whether T&L is pay-to-win, then we’ll respond to some of the common arguments that defend it and finally, I’ll go on a completely unnecessary rant about why people defend it at all. 
- Feel free to skip to the sections you care about using the timestamps but either way, let’s get into it.

### Is T&L Pay-to-Win?
- Okay, what actually is Pay-to-Win? Let’s ask the Cambridge dictionary, which, for some bizarre reason, has an entry for it.
- Okay, so it defines Pay-to-Win as “in computer games, involving or relating to the practice of paying to get weapons, abilities, etc. that give you an advantage over players who do not spend money”
- All right, that’s pretty fair but I think we can condense that to, “in computer games, the practice of spending money to get an advantage over players who do not spend money”. That’s fair right?
- Well, by that standard, I’m sure for most of you, it’s hard to argue that Throne and Liberty *isn’t* pay to win, right?
- Somehow, some people do argue that though, but - okay - before we get to that let’s just make sure T&L definitely does fit this definition.
- There’s two main ways that stand out one first glance - the Lucent system that’s tied to the player marketplace and the battle-pass.
- ***FILL IN HERE.***
- Okay, so I’ve now made the argument that T&L is, in-fact pay-to-win, but of course, not everyone agrees.
- There’s a lot of people who don’t, in fact, and even some YouTubers, who, obviously, have the power to shift narratives, that don’t agree with my assessment. So, okay, let’s talk about… The Arguments Defending It.

### The Arguments Defending It
- Now, before we dive into this section, I wanna be very clear, I’m not dissing anybody, all right? This is not beef. 
- I am responding to arguments from other members of the community but at the end of the day, we’re all players, regardless of whether you’re a YouTuber with a million subs or a viewer wanting to try out the game for the first time, and we’re all in this together and we’re all on the same side of the tug-of-war between the players and NCSoft.
- Okay, so what actually are the arguments defending T&L? Let’s go through them one by one.
	1. The first argument is that at the end of the day, this is business and studios need to make money. 
		- I can see why this argument exists because sure, it’s really silly and naive to ask a studio to run a loss just so we can have a fair game. 
		- The only problem is that, well, pay-to-win isn’t necessary to make money. 
		- Put aside single-player games for a moment because okay there are server costs associated with multiplayer games but there are a ton of multiplayer games that are able to make money without pay-to-win.
		- The most obvious examples are games like Valorant or Apex Legends but you might respond to that by saying “but kets those games are huge, T&L is just a little Korean MMO”. 
		- Well, this little Korean MMO is one of the best-selling games on Steam, ever. Ever. It’s got more players right now than Apex Legends, so to say it’s a scale thing or a size thing doesn’t work.
		- Or, you might, “but kets this an MMO, those are competitive shooters”. So what? What does an MMO do that requires higher margins? Even if it does, Once Human was massively successful while it’s microtransactions were entirely cosmetic, so why can’t T&L? 
		- Then you might say, “but kets of course they’re gonna make as much money as possible, why wouldn’t they?” Well, of course they would - that’s the point, that’s the problem, they’re greedy and want to milk their players for as much as they can. Glad we agree.
	2. The second argument is that you’d have to spend a lot of money, basically be a whale, to be significantly further ahead.
		- I won’t spend much time on this argument. 
		- The amount of money you spend is literally a non-argument. If spending money gives you a gameplay advantage, it’s pay-to-win.
		- On top of this, this isn’t even true for T&L. Consistently buying the battle pass, which is definitely not whaling, is a pretty significant boost so this doesn’t really hold up.
	3. The third common argument, which thankfully is a bit rare but unfortunately exists nonetheless, is that other games do it too.
		- Look, saying other games do it so it’s okay that T&L does it is… really the weakest of these four arguments, because it’s easy to dismiss.
		- Basically, yeah, those games are pay-to-win, and so is this one. That’s it.
	1. And the final one, is that it’s actually not pay-to-win, it’s pay-to-progress faster. This one’s easy to respond to with a thought experiment.
		- Imagine a free-to-play player who plays for a hundred hours and makes it to a certain level of gear, let’s just call it 300 Gear Score. Again, this is a thought experiment, so bare with me and don’t get hung up on these numbers.
		- A pay-to-win player then starts playing and puts some money in, say 300 USD, and that makes him progress twice as fast and he gets to 300 Gear Score in just 50 hours. All right, not pay-to-win, just pay-to-progress faster, right?
		- After all, they’re both at 300, so who cares?
		- Well, let’s say that the pay-to-win player puts in the same number of hours, 100, consistently put Suddenly, he’s gonna be at 600 Gear Score.
		- Do you see it? Both players put in the same amount of time, 100 hours, but free-to-play player is at a significant disadvantage.
		- This, is obviously, pay-to-win. Paying to progress faster is paying to win. 
- So, you know, as much as I, too, want to defend a game I really, really enjoy and as much as I, too want to be able to frame things so that it looks good or not as bad, all these arguments that are used to defend the pay-to-win in this fall apart very easily.
- And honestly, that’s okay! That doesn’t mean that the game isn’t fun. I think T&L is genuinely fun and I’ll continue to have fun in it without ever spending a single dollar on it. 
- But at the end of the day, misrepresenting this game as a non-P2W game is silly, and actually harmful to the genre and the player-base that loves MMOs.
- In fact, this brings us to the final section and it’s something you might already be wondering and that is… Why Is This Even A Question?

### Why Is This Even a Question?
*Duration: 297s.* 
- Okay, I’m gonna preface this section by saying, this isn’t specific to T&L. I’m just gonna on a little rant about Pa  y-to-Win and if that doesn’t interest, I get it, thank you for watching and I’ll see you guys next time.
- The MMO genre isn’t new, and neither is the concept of Pay-to-Win, and honestly, even though its easy to define like we did earlier, the truth is that it manifests in different games in different ways.
	- By the way, if you’re interested in all the different ways pay-to-win sneaks its way into games, I’d recommend Josh Strife Hayes’ video on it which I’ll link in the description below. 
	- He’s sort of the voice of sanity for MMO players and his video is really good.
- The thing is though, the problem actually isn’t the existence of pay-to-win itself, publishers are always gonna wanna make more and more money, that’s almost like a law of nature. 
- Instead, the real problem is the really incredible way that publishers have managed to slowly push the acceptable line further and further back and how we’ve been okay with it.
- I mean, think about it!
- In the early days of MMO, the line players drew was the very existence of microtransaction s. Everyone preferred a buy-to-play or subscription-based model as long as it had zero pay-to-win.
- Then, that line got pushed back to cosmetic microtransactions – mounts and skins and we were okay with that because who cares, right? You don’t get any real advantage, you just get to look cooler. So that became the new normal.
- Then the line got pushed again – potions and minor convenience like a bigger inventory or bank space. That was weird but whatever, just a small amount up from cosmetics, so that became the new normal.
- Then, it got pushed again, inventory and bank space got so small that it was just unreasonable to not expand it. Fine! It’s just bag space, it’s not pay-to-win, right? So that became the new normal.
- And so, and so forth. Slowly, but surely, over the course of over a decade, this line of what is “acceptable pay-to-win” got pushed and pushed and pushed until now, we’re at its peak, where you can buy earned currency or even equipment directly for real money and there are battle passes that just gives you materials. 
- And honestly, part of the blame is is on us, all of us as players – it’s kind of our fault. Every time that line got pushed from no microtransactions to cosmetics to convenience outright buying power, we accepted it.
- It’s not entirely on us because it was the studios that kept pushing but it was still on us to make a stand and instead, we gave them money and over time, they realized we will always give them money as long as the jumps they make in how they extract that money from us is subtle.
- We’re now at a point where, forget Throne and Liberty, pay-to-win of this scale now exists even in pay-to-play and subscription based games. 
- Hell, monetization has gotten so silly that we’re sold early access for the price of a triple A game and we’re asked to pay the price of TWO triple A games to alpha test an MMO!
- And the worst thing is – a lot of us are shockingly okay with it!  Okay, look at this absolutely insane comment I saw under the Ashes of Creation Alpha 2 announcement.
- I’m gonna try and read it without laughing.
- **READ COMMENT**.
- Okay, can somebody tell me what’s going on here? No, no no, really, what is this? Someone please tell me what the hell this is because who even thinks like this? Excuse my language but holy shit man we are so fucked as a community. I mean this is so insane I’m in genuine disbelief. There’s bootlicking and then there’s whatever the hell this is.
- but thing is that *this* is where we are. We’re so far gone we’re paying developers money to do their job and jumping up and down to do it like monkeys for a banana.
- It’s so bad, in fact, that truth be told, I personally don’t know if we can ever go back. 
- This isn’t a problem is most other genres either. Can you imagine the backlash if Valorant made it so that you had to pay real money to use a specific gun? Or if Elden Ring sold its best weapons for real money or in a battle pass? 
- Of course, not, because players of many others genres still have reasonable standards.
- We, as MMO players, have pretty much made it clear that we’re okay with pay-to-win and they know that now and that, unfortunately, is on all of us.
- So what can we even do about this? You must be thinking hey this guy’s been going on for so long and there aren’t even any subway surfers clips so surely he’s got a suggestion. 
- Well, honestly, there’s not a lot we can but at the very least, I hope that going forward, as a community, we can maybe just call it like we see it. 
- Maybe you don’t care about the pay-to-win, and that’s fine, to each their own, right, but again, at the very least, let’s get rid of these dumb labels like pay-to-progress-faster and pay-for-convenience. 
- Let’s call pay-to-win, pay-to-win, because we have to stop letting these studios convince us otherwise.
### Outro
*Duration: 56s.* 
- So there you have it. 
- TLDR: Throne and Liberty is, by definition, without a doubt, Pay-To-Win. You may think the amount of pay-to-win isn’t enough to stop you and I’d agree. 
- I promise you, you can have a *ton* of fun regardless. I have been and will be having a lot of fun without spending a time.
- But, it *is* pay-to-win. It’s pay-for-convenience and it’s pay-to-progress faster, but that is pay-to-win. 
- Now, as promised at the start of the video, I’m done talking. It’s time for you guys to talk! What do you think? Do you think we’ll ever be able to get an MMO that actually isn’t pay-to-win again?
- Will we EVER be able to stop pretending that pay-for-convenience and pay-to-progress-faster aren’t pay to win?
- Let’s talk in the comments below!
- Make sure to subscribe to my channel for more MMO-content but besides that, as always, thank you for watching and I’ll see you guys next time!
