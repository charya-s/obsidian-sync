Now that T&L has begun its early access, there’s a lot of conversation around whether its a Pay-to-Win game or not. For some reason, there’s a lot of people who seem to have come to the conclusion that it isn’t. They’re wrong, here’s why and why this is a problem for the whole genre.

## Notes

### Intro 
*Duration: 59s.* 
- Hello everybody and welcome… to another Throne and Liberty video where we are going to maybe piss off a few people. 
- The game is now in its Early Access stage until it fully comes out on the 1st of October and the question of whether it is Pay-To-Win is one that’s generating a lot of discussion.
- There are people who swear it is and there are people who say it’s not really pay-to-win and instead it’s just pay-for-convenience.
- Now of you just want to know if T&L is Pay-to-Win or not, I won’t waste your time. It is, it definitely is pay-to-win.
- So why are people pretending it’s not? Let’s talk about that. Or, at least, I’ll talk about it first and then afterwards, we can talk about it together in the comments. 
- We’re gonna go step by step, cover every aspect, respond to every argument from those who say it’s not pay-to-win, and basically we’ll settle this for good by really just taking a good look at it.

### How Is T&L Pay-to-Win?
- Okay, what actually is Pay-to-Win? Well, let’s ask the Cambridge dictionary, which has an entry for it for some bizarre reason.
- Okay, it defines Pay-to-Win as “in computer games, involving or relating to the practice of paying to get weapons, abilities, etc. that give you an advantage over players who do not spend money”
- All right, that’s pretty fair but I think we can condense that to, “in computer games, the practice of spending money to get an advantage over players who do not spend money”. That’s fair right?
- Well, by that standard, I’m sure for most of you, it’s hard to argue that Throne and Liberty *isn’t* pay to win, right?
- Somehow, some people do argue that though, but - okay - before we get to that let’s just make sure T&L definitely does fit this definition.
- There’s two main ways that stand out one first glance - the Lucent system that’s tied to the player marketplace and the battle-pass.
- 

### The Arguments Against It
- Okay, so I’ve now made the argument that T&L is, in-fact pay-to-win, but of course, not everyone agrees.
- There’s a lot of people who don’t, in fact, and even some YouTubers that don’t. 
- Now, I wanna be very clear, I’m not sneak dissing anybody, all right? This is not beef. We’re all players and we’re all in this together on this side of the interaction between players and NCSoft.
- So what are these arguments? Okay, let’s go through them.
	1. The first is that…
	2. The second argument is that…
	3. The third common argument is that…
	4. And the final one, which is a lot less common but nonetheless exists, is…
- So, you know, as much as I, too, want to defend a game I really, really enjoy and as much as I want to be able to frame thing such that it looks good or not as bad, all these arguments that are use fall apart under, honestly, very little scrutiny.

### Why Is This Even a Question?

### Outro
*Duration: 50s.* 
- So there you have it. 
- TLDR: Throne and Liberty is, by definition, without a doubt, Pay-To-Win. You may think the amount of pay-to-win isn’t enough to stop you and I’d agree. 
- I promise you, you can have a *ton* of fun regardless. I have been and will be having a lot of fun without spending a time.
- But, it *is* pay-to-win. It’s pay-for-convenience and it’s pay-to-progress faster, but that is pay-to-win. 
- Now, as promised at the start of the video, I’m done talking. It’s time for you guys to talk! What do you think? Do you think we’ll ever be able to get an MMO that actually isn’t pay-to-win again? Let’s talk in the comments below!
- Make sure to subscribe to my channel for more MMO-content but besides that, as always, thank you for watching and I’ll see you guys next time!
