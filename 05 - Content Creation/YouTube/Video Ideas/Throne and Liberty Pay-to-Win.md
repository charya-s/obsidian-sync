Now that T&L has begun its early access, there’s a lot of conversation around whether its a Pay-to-Win game or not. For some reason, there’s a lot of people who seem to have come to the conclusion that it isn’t. They’re wrong, here’s why and why this is a problem for the whole genre.

## Notes

### Intro 
*Duration: 59s.* 
- Hello everybody and welcome… to another Throne and Liberty video where we are going to maybe piss off a few people. 
- The game is now in its Early Access stage until it fully comes out on the 1st of October and the question of whether it is Pay-To-Win is one that’s generating a lot of discussion.
- There are people who swear it is and there are people who say it’s not really pay-to-win and instead it’s just pay-for-convenience.
- Now of you just want to know if T&L is Pay-to-Win or not, I won’t waste your time. It is, it definitely is pay-to-win.
- So why are people pretending it’s not? Let’s talk about that. Or, at least, I’ll talk about it first and then afterwards, we can talk about it together in the comments. 
- We’re gonna go step by step, cover every aspect, respond to every argument from those who say it’s not pay-to-win, and basically we’ll settle this for good by really just taking a good look at it.

### Is T&L Pay-to-Win?
- Okay, what actually is Pay-to-Win? Let’s ask the Cambridge dictionary, which, for some bizarre reason, has an entry for it.
- Okay, so it defines Pay-to-Win as “in computer games, involving or relating to the practice of paying to get weapons, abilities, etc. that give you an advantage over players who do not spend money”
- All right, that’s pretty fair but I think we can condense that to, “in computer games, the practice of spending money to get an advantage over players who do not spend money”. That’s fair right?
- Well, by that standard, I’m sure for most of you, it’s hard to argue that Throne and Liberty *isn’t* pay to win, right?
- Somehow, some people do argue that though, but - okay - before we get to that let’s just make sure T&L definitely does fit this definition.
- There’s two main ways that stand out one first glance - the Lucent system that’s tied to the player marketplace and the battle-pass.
- ***FILL IN HERE.***
- Okay, so I’ve now made the argument that T&L is, in-fact pay-to-win, but of course, not everyone agrees.
- There’s a lot of people who don’t, in fact, and even some YouTubers, who, obviously, have the power to shift narratives, that don’t agree with my assessment. So, okay, let’s talk about… The Arguments Defending It.

### The Arguments Defending It
- Now, before we dive into this section, I wanna be very clear, I’m not sneak dissing anybody, all right? This is not beef. 
- At the end of the day, we’re all players, regardless of whether you’re a YouTuber with a million subs or a viewer wanting to try out the game for the first time, and we’re all in this together and we’re all on the same side of the interaction between players and NCSoft.
- Okay, so what actually are the arguments defending T&L? Let’s go through them one by one.
	1. The first is that… ***FILL IN HERE.*** It’s pay-to-progress faster, not pay-to-win.
	2. The second argument is that… ***FILL IN HERE.*** Studios need to make money, it’s a business.
	3. The third common argument, which thankfully is a bit rare but unfortunately exists nonetheless is that… ***FILL IN HERE.*** You’d have to spend a lot to be significantly further ahead - “whaling”.
	4. And the final one, is… ***FILL IN HERE.*** Other games do it too! Let’s talk about this more.
- So, you know, as much as I, too, want to defend a game I really, really enjoy and as much as I, too want to be able to frame things so that it looks good or not as bad, all these arguments that are used to defend the pay-to-win in this fall apart very easily.
- And honestly, that’s okay! That doesn’t mean that the game isn’t fun. I think T&L is genuinely fun and I’ll continue to have fun in it without ever spending a single dollar on it. 
- But at the end of the day, misrepresenting this game as a non-P2W game is silly, and actually harmful to the genre and the player-base that loves MMOs.
- In fact, this brings us to the final section and it’s something you might already be wondering and that is… Why Is This Even A Question?

### Why Is This Even a Question?
- The MMO genre isn’t new, and neither is the concept of Pay-to-Win, and honestly, even though its easy to define like we did earlier, the truth is that it manifests in different games in different ways.
	- By the way, if you’re interested in all the different ways pay-to-win sneaks its way into games, I’d recommend Josh Strife Hayes’ video on it which I’ll link in the description below. 
	- He’s sort of the voice of sanity for MMO players and his video is really good.
- The thing is though, the problem actually isn’t the existence of pay-to-win itself, it’s the really incredible way that publishers have managed to slowly push the acceptable line further and further back.
- I mean, think about it!
- In the early days of MMO, the line players drew was the very existence of microtransactions. Everyone preferred a buy-to-play or subscription-based model as long as it had zero pay-to-win.
- Then, that line got pushed back to cosmetic microtransactions – mounts and skins and we were okay with that because who cares, right? You don’t get any real advantage, you just get to look cooler. So that became the new normal.
- Then the line got pushed again – potions and minor convenience like a bigger inventory or bank space. That was weird but whatever, just a small amount up from cosmetics, so that became the new normal.
- Then, it got pushed again, inventory and bank space got so small that it was just unreasonable to not expand it. Fine! It’s just bag space, it’s not pay-to-win, right? So that became the new normal.
- Guess what, the line got pushed again – battle passes! First they were cosmetic or convenience, and we were still okay with that, and then slowly and subtly these battlepasses started to 
### Outro
*Duration: 50s.* 
- So there you have it. 
- TLDR: Throne and Liberty is, by definition, without a doubt, Pay-To-Win. You may think the amount of pay-to-win isn’t enough to stop you and I’d agree. 
- I promise you, you can have a *ton* of fun regardless. I have been and will be having a lot of fun without spending a time.
- But, it *is* pay-to-win. It’s pay-for-convenience and it’s pay-to-progress faster, but that is pay-to-win. 
- Now, as promised at the start of the video, I’m done talking. It’s time for you guys to talk! What do you think? Do you think we’ll ever be able to get an MMO that actually isn’t pay-to-win again? Let’s talk in the comments below!
- Make sure to subscribe to my channel for more MMO-content but besides that, as always, thank you for watching and I’ll see you guys next time!
