## Notes

### Intro
- Hello everybody and welcome to another Throne and Liberty video where this time, we’re gonna talk about the Staff/Crossbow combination and how you can maximize your DPS when playing it.
- Now, this is a bit of an off-meta combination but don’t let that fool you. Yes, there are a few downsides which we’ll talk about it in a bit but this combination is unreasonably good at DPS and it’s actually very easy for you to top out in dungeons.
- I actually think this combination is kind of a hidden gem so if you are interested in it, keep watching because we’re gonna try and cover everything about it.
- As always, timestamps are available below if you just wanna see the skill build, gearing guide, or any other section.

### General Information
- This combination synergizes really, really well together and is based around two things: constant movement and damage over time through burning.
- We fight from mid-range, only getting within melee range for one skill. Just one, so 95% of the time, you need to be moving and not standing close or standing still at all.
	- Really, the only time it’s okay to be standing still is if it’s a boss fight and you have a good tank that’s always drawing aggro and there’s no danger of you being chased by the boss.
- So that’s the general playstyle of the combination, we’ll get into the details in a bit but before we do, we need to acknowledge that there are a couple of major downsides to this combination.
	- The first is that the AoE damage isn’t as good as the Staff/Longbow or Staff/Wand.
		- The crossbow is simply not an AoE focused weapon so you do lose a bit of that.
	- The second issue is that there’s not a lot of self-sustain.
		- Now, I say “not a lot”, but really, it’s pretty much zero, so you need to be careful when you’re soloing because getting hit kinda sucks. 
- That said though, there are also a couple of major upsides to this combination.
	- Firstly, it makes up for the reduced AoE damage by being absolutely amazing at single-target DPS.
		- This makes you really valuable in boss fights and you’ll often top out the DPS charts in dungeons because of it.
	- The second thing is that since we’re never really standing still, self-sustain isn’t actually as big of a deal since you end up getting hit way less as a result. 
- Now, the last thing I wanna mention, and I’m being super honest here because fraud is a crime, is that this combination is not very good when you’re solo early on in the game. 
	- I don’t mean during levelling, I mean when you’ve just reached endgame and you’re starting to do Abyss dungeons and such, you might struggle a bit.
	- This changes a lot though, as you gear up and improve you health regen and magic and range endurance values, you’re gonna start clearing dungeons incredibly fast.
- But okay, we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s start by looking at… The Skill Build.

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manaball Eruption   | Extra damage that scales with mana regen which is gonna be a big focus for this build.                                                                                                                       |
| Mana Amp            | Increases max mana and health which is just always good.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Flame Condensation  | Increases the damage over time of Burning, which actually is a big chunk of the DPS of this build.                                                                                                           |
| Forbidden Sanctuary | Increases skill damage which is really nice.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Eagle Vision        | Boosts your Magic and Ranged Hit Chances. The increase goes up with distance but honestly, you don’t need to think about distance at all, just attack as you see fit and the boost is more than good enough. |
| Ambidexterity       | Boosts the damage of your off-hand weapon and boosts critical hit. Since we attack with both weapons, this is good no matter which of the two is your off-hand weapon.                                       |
| Bloodlust           | Increases skill damage and every ten attacks, increases crit damage. This requires no manual input and it’s a nice boost to have that scales a lot as you level it up.                                       |
| Detection           | Whenever you get hit, there’s a chance you’ll gain additional movement speed and evasion, which can really help you survive if you get mobbed.                                                               |

### Outro
- And there you have it, that was the all-in-one guide to the Staff/Crossbow combination in Throne and Liberty!
- I’ve been playing this combination since the game launched globally and it’s definitely one of the most fun classes I’ve played so far.
- Yes, it’s not the easiest because you really need to pay attention to make sure you’re avoiding getting hit, but in my opinion a higher skill ceiling just makes it more fun.
- Besides, once you do learn to use it effectively, it becomes an insane class capable of being around top in most activities in the game.
- Anyway, I hope I’ve encouraged you to give this combination a go or if you already are, helped you understand it a bit better. 
- As always, make sure to subscribe to my channel below for more MMO-related content but beyond that, thank you for watching and I’ll see you guys next time.
