## Notes

### Intro
- 

### General Information
- We fight from mid-range.
- Constantly moving - realistically we’ll never be standing still and casting unless we absolutely can (we have a good tank drawing aggression).
	- This is in contrast to both Staff/Wand and Staff/Longbow, who actually benefit from standing still when fighting.
- The downsides of this combination are:
	- The AoE isn’t as good as the Staff/Longbow or Staff/Wand.
	- There’s not a lot of self-sustain, so you need to be careful.
- The upsides of this combination are:
	- It makes up for the reduced AoE by being amazing at single-target DPS, which makes you hugely valuable in boss fights.
	- Since we’re never standing still, self-sustain isn’t as big of a deal since you get hit way less. Just using potions and making sure your movement is good will make up for it in most cases.
