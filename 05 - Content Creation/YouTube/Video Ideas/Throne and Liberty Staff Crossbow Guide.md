## Notes

### Intro
- Hello everybody and welcome to another Throne and Liberty video where this time, we’re gonna talk about the Staff/Crossbow combination and how you can maximize your DPS when playing it.
- Now, this is a bit of an off-meta combination but don’t let that fool you. Yes, there are a few downsides which we’ll talk about it in a bit but this combination is unreasonably good at DPS and it’s actually very easy for you to top out in dungeons.
- I actually think this combination is kind of a hidden gem so if you are interested in it, keep watching because we’re gonna try and cover everything about it.
- As always, timestamps are available below if you just wanna see the skill build, gearing guide, or any other section.

### General Information
- This combination synergizes really, really well together and is based around two things: constant movement and damage over time through burning.
- We fight from mid-range, only getting within melee range for one skill. Just one, so 95% of the time, you need to be moving and not standing close or standing still at all.
	- Really, the only time it’s okay to be standing still is if it’s a boss fight and you have a good tank that’s always drawing aggro and there’s no danger of you being chased by the boss.
- So that’s the general playstyle of the combination, we’ll get into the details in a bit but before we do, we need to acknowledge that there are a couple of major downsides to this combination.
	- The first is that the AoE damage isn’t as good as the Staff/Longbow or Staff/Wand.
		- The crossbow is simply not an AoE focused weapon so you do lose a bit of that.
	- The second issue is that there’s not a lot of self-sustain.
		- Now, I say “not a lot”, but really, it’s pretty much zero, so you need to be careful when you’re soloing because getting hit kinda sucks. 
- That said though, there are also a couple of major upsides to this combination.
	- Firstly, it makes up for the reduced AoE damage by being absolutely amazing at single-target DPS.
		- This makes you really valuable in boss fights and you’ll often top out the DPS charts in dungeons because of it.
	- The second thing is that since we’re never really standing still, self-sustain isn’t actually as big of a deal since you end up getting hit way less as a result. 
- Now, the last thing I wanna mention, and I’m being super honest here because fraud is a crime, is that this combination is not very good when you’re solo early on in the game. 
	- I don’t mean during levelling, I mean when you’ve just reached endgame and you’re starting to do Abyss dungeons and such, you might struggle a bit.
	- This changes a lot though, as you gear up and improve you health regen and magic and range endurance values, you’re gonna start clearing dungeons incredibly fast.
- But okay, we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s start by looking at… The Skill Build.
