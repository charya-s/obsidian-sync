## Notes

### Intro
- Hello everybody and welcome to another Throne and Liberty video where this time, we’re gonna talk about the Staff/Crossbow combination and how you can maximize your DPS when playing it.
- Now, this is a bit of an off-meta combination but don’t let that fool you. Yes, there are a few downsides which we’ll talk about it in a bit but this combination is unreasonably good at DPS and it’s actually very easy for you to top out in dungeons.
- I actually think this combination is kind of a hidden gem so if you are interested in it, keep watching because we’re gonna try and cover everything about it.
- As always, timestamps are available below if you just wanna see the skill build, gearing guide, or any other section.

### General Information
- This combination synergizes really, really well together and is based around two things: constant movement and damage over time through burning.
- We fight from mid-range, only getting within melee range for one skill. Just one, so 95% of the time, you need to be moving and not standing close or standing still at all.
	- Really, the only time it’s okay to be standing still is if it’s a boss fight and you have a good tank that’s always draw
- Constantly moving - realistically we’ll never be standing still and casting unless we absolutely can (we have a good tank drawing aggression).
	- This is in contrast to both Staff/Wand and Staff/Longbow, who actually benefit from standing still when fighting.
- The downsides of this combination are:
	- The AoE isn’t as good as the Staff/Longbow or Staff/Wand.
	- There’s not a lot of self-sustain, so you need to be careful.
- The upsides of this combination are:
	- It makes up for the reduced AoE by being amazing at single-target DPS, which makes you hugely valuable in boss fights.
	- Since we’re never standing still, self-sustain isn’t as big of a deal since you get hit way less. Just using potions and making sure your movement is good will make up for it in most cases.
