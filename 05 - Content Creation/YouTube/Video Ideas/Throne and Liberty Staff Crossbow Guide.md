## Notes

### Intro 
*Duration: 40s.* 
- Hello everybody and welcome to another Throne and Liberty video where this time, we’re gonna talk about the Staff/Crossbow combination and how you can maximize your DPS when playing it.
- Now, this is a bit of an off-meta combination but don’t let that fool you. Yes, there are a few downsides which we’ll talk about it in a bit but this combination is unreasonably good at DPS and it’s actually very easy for you to top out in dungeons.
- I actually think this combination is kind of a hidden gem so if you are interested in it, keep watching because we’re gonna try and cover everything about it.
- As always, timestamps are available below if you just wanna see the skill build, gearing guide, or any other section.
- For more MMO-related content, make sure to subscribe to my channel below but let’s stop dillying and dallying and jump right into it.

### General Information
*Duration: 116s.* 
- This combination synergizes really, really well together and is based around two things: constant movement and damage over time through burning.
- We fight from mid-range, only getting within melee range for one skill. Just one, so 95% of the time, you need to be moving and not standing close or standing still at all.
	- Really, the only time it’s okay to be standing still is if it’s a boss fight and you have a good tank that’s always drawing aggro and there’s no danger of you being chased by the boss.
- So that’s the general playstyle of the combination, we’ll get into the details in a bit but before we do, we need to acknowledge that there are a couple of major downsides to this combination.
	- The first is that the AoE damage isn’t as good as the Staff/Longbow or Staff/Wand.
		- The crossbow is simply not an AoE focused weapon so you do lose a bit of that.
	- The second issue is that there’s not a lot of self-sustain.
		- Now, I say “not a lot”, but really, it’s pretty much zero, so you need to be careful when you’re soloing because getting hit kinda sucks. 
- That said though, there are also a couple of major upsides to this combination.
	- Firstly, it makes up for the reduced AoE damage by being absolutely amazing at single-target DPS.
		- This makes you really valuable in boss fights and you’ll often top out the DPS charts in dungeons because of it.
	- The second thing is that since we’re never really standing still, self-sustain isn’t actually as big of a deal since you end up getting hit way less as a result. 
- Now, the last thing I wanna mention, and I’m being super honest here because fraud is a crime, is that this combination is not very good when you’re solo early on in the game. 
	- I don’t mean during levelling, I mean when you’ve just reached endgame and you’re starting to do Abyss dungeons and such, you might struggle a bit.
	- This changes a lot though, as you gear up and improve you health regen and magic and range endurance values, you’re gonna start clearing dungeons incredibly fast.
- But okay, we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s start by looking at… The Skill Build.

### Skill Build
*Duration: 00s.* 
- Okay, so as with any other combination, you’ve got 12 active skill slots and 8 passive skill slots. Let’s start with the active skills and their specializations. 

##### Actives

| Skill                       | Specialization                                                  | Notes                                                                                                        | Specialization Notes                                                                                                                                                                      | When to Use                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quick Fire**              | Gale, Min Chain Fire                                            | Basic crossbow attack.                                                                                       | Adds gale, which is a delayed explosion and increases the number of hits by 1.                                                                                                            | You’ll be using this a lot whenever possible   really since it’s your basic damage.                                               |
| **Serial Fire Bombs**       | Focused Fire Bombs,<br>Mobility, <br>Projectile Speed Increased | Basic staff attack.                                                                                          | Changes it to Focused Fire Bombs, which hits harder and does AoE splash damage. Mobility makes it so that you can cast it while moving and increased projectile speed helps increase DPS. | You should be using this on cooldown since it deals a very significant chunk of your damage and applies burning.                  |
| **Merciless Barrage**       | Annihilation Barrage Shot                                       | The only AoE attack on the crossbow.                                                                         | Changes it to an attack that does AoE damage in a circle around you.                                                                                                                      | Use this once you’ve gathered a few mobs or if a boss is not about to do an AoE attack and you can safely get within melee range. |
| **Chain Lightning**         | Damage Transfer,<br>Damage Transfer                             | AoE lightning damage and does more damage to burning targets.                                                | Makes it so that it always chains between enemies and there’s no drop off in damage when it does.                                                                                         | Use whenever possible but make sure that burning is applied beforehand for maximum damage.                                        |
| **Recoil Shot**             | Wave Shot, <br>Off-Hand Weapon Attack                           | Whenever you use a skill that moves you, you gain repulsive force, and this skill consumes it to do damage.  | Adds the Wave Shot effect, which makes it do extra damage if you stack Repulsive Force to 3 before you use it. Off-Hand Weapon Attack just improves its damage a bit.                     | You should stack Repulsive Force to 3 and then use this to get the maximum effect.                                                |
| **Inferno Wave**            | Consecutive Use,<br>Burning                                     | Does AoE fire damage which is increased if the target is burning.                                            | Makes it so that you can use it twice 50% of the time and burning adds 3 stacks of… well, burning.                                                                                        | Use whenever possible, don’t worry too much about whether burning is already applied, it’s still worth using regardless.          |
| **Judgement Lightning**     | Damage Transfer,<br>Damage Transfer                             | Does a large amount of AoE lightning damage, with a chance to re-use it instantly if the target is burning.  | Makes it so that it always chains between enemies and there’s no drop off in damage when it does.                                                                                         | Use whenever possible but make sure that burning is applied beforehand for the chance to use it twice in a row.                   |
| **Infernal Meteor**         | -                                                               | Huge AoE fire damage that applies burning.                                                                   | -                                                                                                                                                                                         | Only really use this in group fights where you’re not being attacked at all since it has a long, stationary casting period.       |
| **Selfless Diffusion**      | Aggression                                                      | Self-buff that decreases cooldowns and boosts damage a bit.                                                  | Reduces the aggression you gain when you attack whi  ch is nice for staying safe in group content.                                                                                        | Pretty much keep active at all times, on cooldown.                                                                                |
| **Mana Exchange**           | Skill Effect Enhanced, <br>Stamina Recovery                     | Consumes HP to regain MP.                                                                                    | Increases the HP cost and the MP regained and we get added stamina recovery which is nice.                                                                                                | You don’t need this as much, but it’s nice to have for when you run out of mana which happens relatively often.                   |
| **Mother Nature’s Protest** | Flame Arrow                                                     | Toggled skill which basically makes all your projectile attacks from both weapons shoot a second projectile. | The second projectile is a flame arrow which applies Burning.                                                                                                                             | You essentially want this activated all the time, with no exceptions whatsoever. The damage boost is very significant.            |
| **High Focus**              | Base Damage Boost                                               | Self-buff that increases cooldown speed and movement speed.                                                  | Adds a damage boost to the buff.                                                                                                                                                          | Pretty much keep active at all times, on cooldown.                                                                                |
##### Passives

| Skill               | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manaball Eruption   | Extra damage that scales with mana regen which is gonna be a big focus for this build.                                                                                                                       |
| Mana Amp            | Increases max mana and health which is just always good.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Flame Condensation  | Increases the damage over time of Burning, which actually is a big chunk of the DPS of this build.                                                                                                           |
| Forbidden Sanctuary | Increases skill damage which is really nice.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Eagle Vision        | Boosts your Magic and Ranged Hit Chances. The increase goes up with distance but honestly, you don’t need to think about distance at all, just attack as you see fit and the boost is more than good enough. |
| Ambidexterity       | Boosts the damage of your off-hand weapon and boosts critical hit. Since we attack with both weapons, this is good no matter which of the two is your off-hand weapon.                                       |
| Bloodlust           | Increases skill damage and every ten attacks, increases crit damage. This requires no manual input and it’s a nice boost to have that scales a lot as you level it up.                                       |
| Detection           | Whenever you get hit, there’s a chance you’ll gain additional movement speed and evasion, which can really help you survive if you get mobbed.                                                               |


### Rotation and Playstyle
*Duration: 00s.* 
- Let’s start with the buffs:
	- First and foremost, Mother Nature’s Protest should be toggled on at all times. Yes, it does increase mana costs but the increase in DPS is very significant and it makes sure that you are constantly applying burning so it’s definitely worth having it on all the time.
	- Selfless Diffusion and High Focus aren’t toggled but should be used on cooldown whenever available because they impact your DPS a lot and there’s never a reason not to keep them up as much as possible.
	- Mana Exchange, on the other hand, should only really be used if you have plenty of health and you’re running out of mana. It is useful but you don’t need to use it outside of that scenario.
- Then for damage, there’s three types of attacks: priority attacks, filler attacks and situational attacks.
	- Priority attacks should be used on cooldown whenever they’re available while filler attacks are best used in between them.
	- Situational attacks are only useful in specific scenarios which we’ll talk about in a sec.
- There are three priority attacks.
	- The first of these is Focused Fire Bombs. This does a very nice chunk of damage and applies burning, which is not just a damage over time, but also boosts the damage of other skills.
	- Next is Recoil Shot, but only with 3 stacks of Repulsive Force. Using this skill without 3 stacks of repulsive force is pretty much never recommended, since there’s a pretty big difference in the amount of damage.
	- The last priority attack is Judgement Lightning. Now, this skill does do more damage if burning is applied when you use it, but realistically, you don’t really have to think about this that much because you should pretty much have burning applied at all times from your other skills.
- Okay, then we have the 3 filler skills. 
	- The first is Quick Shot. This is a nice basic attack that adds a delayed explosion thanks to Gale and does a nice bit of damage. 
	- Then, you have Chain Lightning, which is like a miniature version of Judgement Lightning and works almost identically, just with less damage and a smaller cooldown. Again, you don’t need to manually make sure burning is applied before you use this because it should be all the time.
	- The final filler skill is Inferno Wave, which is a nice AoE skill that also applies burning.
- All right, then the two remaining active skills are the two situational attacks.
	- The first is Annihilation Barrage Shot, which does a lot of AoE damage in a circle around you. The only problem is that you have to get within melee range and that makes it kind of risky to use. 
	- The second situational attack is Infernal Meteor, which is another very strong AoE attack. The downside of this skill is that it has a pretty long casting time during which you can’t move at all, so while you cast it, you’re pretty much entirely open to attack. 
	- Now, both of these skills are still very good in two situations: one is if you’ve gathered a mobs and you feel safe that they can’t do a lot of damage to you while you use these skills. The other is during group content, whether that’s a boss or just farming in a group, where a tank or another teammate is controlling aggro and you’re not in danger of being hit. In either of these scenarios, both of these skills can become priority attacks because of the amount of damage they can do, but outside of those scenarios, they should be used pretty cautiously.
- Okay, so those are the skills of this class. Hopefully, categorizing them into categories like this helps you understand them a bit better without forcing you into strict rotations.

### Blue & Purple Gear Builds
*Duration: 00s.* 
- Okay, so with the skills out of the way, the last thing I wanna talk about is gear. 
- There’s two sets of gear you’ll have over time: one interim set that’s made up of blue or rare equipment and one end-game set that’s made up of purple or epic equipment.
- Okay, with that in mind, let’s start by looking at the interim set.
- Now before I talk about specific pieces of equipment, I wanna point out that for this interim set, you don’t actually need to match it one-to-one. 
- Any full set of blues will work perfectly well since the whole point of this set is just to hold you over while you work on the end-game set.
- The specific blue pieces I’ll be about are just my recommendation and where to get them. 
- **Go through table.**
- Now, again, and I really wanna make this clear: you can swap these blue pieces out as you want, because it’s just an interim set to use while working towards the purple gear.
- Okay, so speaking of the purple gear, what does that set look like?
- Well, before we talk about that, I wanna mention that I’m not going to go into the specific traits of each piece of equipment in this video because I wanna focus more on the equipment themselves and where to get that. 
- That said, there will be a link in the description below to the full build, which does includes traits as well so do make sure to check that out if you want to know which ones are best.

### Outro
*Duration: 40s.* 
- And there you have it, that was the all-in-one guide to the Staff/Crossbow combination in Throne and Liberty!
- I’ve been playing this combination since the game launched globally and it’s definitely one of the most fun classes I’ve played so far.
- Yes, it’s not the easiest because you really need to pay attention to make sure you’re avoiding getting hit, but in my opinion a higher skill ceiling just makes it more fun.
- Besides, once you do learn to use it effectively, it becomes an insane class capable of being around top in most activities in the game.
- Anyway, I hope I’ve encouraged you to give this combination a go or if you already are, helped you understand it a bit better. 
- As always, make sure to subscribe to my channel below for more MMO-related content but beyond that, thank you for watching and I’ll see you guys next time.
