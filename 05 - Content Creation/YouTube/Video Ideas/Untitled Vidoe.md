Now that T&L has begun its early access, there’s a lot of conversation around whether its a Pay-to-Win game or not. For some reason, there’s a lot of people who seem to have come to the conclusion that it isn’t. They’re wrong, here’s why and why this is a problem for the whole genre.

## Notes

### Intro
- Hello everybody and welcome… to another Throne and Liberty video where we are going to maybe piss off a few people. 
- The game is now in its Early Access stage until it fully comes out on the 1st of October and the question of whether it is Pay-To-Win is one that’s generating a lot of discussion.
- There are people who swear it is and there are people who say it’s not really pay-to-win and instead it’s just pay-for-convenience.
- Now of you just want to know if T&L is Pay-to-Win or not, I won’t waste your time. It is, it definitely is pay-to-win.
- So why are people pretending it’s not? Let’s talk about that. Or, at least, I’ll talk about it first and then afterwards, we can talk about it together in the comments.

### Outro
- So there you have it. 
- TLDR: Throne and Liberty is, by definition, without a doubt, Pay-To-Win. You may think the amount of pay-to-win isn’t enough to stop you and I’d agree. 
- I promise you, you can have a *ton* of fun regardless. I have been and will be having a lot of fun without spending a time.
- But, it *is* pay-to-win. It’s pay-for-convenience and it’s pay-to-progress faster, but that is pay-to-win. 
- Now, as promised at the start of the video, I’m done talking. It’s time for you guys to talk! What do you think? Do you think we’ll ever be able to get an MMO that actually isn’t pay-to-win again? Let’s talk in the comments below!
- Make sure to subscribe to my channel for more MMO-content but besides that, as always, thank you for watching and I’ll see you guys next time!
