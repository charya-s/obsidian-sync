Consider the following postulates:
- High view count corresponds to more clicks based on title and thumbnail.
- High impressions count corresponds to more visibility of the video in search and recommendations.
- High view time corresponds to interesting content.

Then, consider the following postulates:
- The highest view counts have been for guides.
- The highest impressions have been for guides.
- The longest watch time has been for reviews.

Therefore, it can be theorized that:
- Guides bring in more viewers overall.
- Reviews are more interesting content to those who want it.
